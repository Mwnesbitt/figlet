This project implement a college assignment in java into python.  I wanted to do this in order to practice classes and 
inheritance in python, and also because the assignment was pretty cool.  It'll be nice to have in my library of projects
in the future, especially for practicing user I/O, possibly through a browser with the code hosted on a server.

I didn't comment too heavily.  My college assignment had a good deal of comments explaining the code, but I didn't
copy those over.  

I need a bit more familiarity with how to read/write to a file, including best practices.
